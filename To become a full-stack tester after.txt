To become a full-stack tester after mastering **Selenium with Java**, you need to expand your skill set to cover both **front-end** and **back-end** testing, as well as **database** and **API** testing. Hereâ€™s a structured roadmap:

### 1. **API Testing**
   - **Tools**: Postman, RestAssured (Java-based), SoapUI
   - **Skills**: 
     - Learn how to test RESTful APIs and SOAP web services.
     - Understand HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
     - Write automated tests for APIs using Java and tools like RestAssured.
   - **Authentication**: Learn about API authentication (OAuth, Basic Auth, etc.).

### 2. **Database Testing**
   - **Tools**: JDBC (Java Database Connectivity), SQL
   - **Skills**:
     - Understand SQL queries to validate backend data.
     - Learn how to connect Java programs to databases and perform CRUD operations.
     - Validate data consistency, perform database integration testing.
   
### 3. **Backend Automation Testing**
   - **Skills**:
     - Understand how business logic operates on the server side.
     - Learn to automate back-end services and workflows without a UI.
   - **Framework**: Learn how to write back-end tests using Java-based testing frameworks like **TestNG** or **JUnit**.

### 4. **Performance Testing**
   - **Tools**: JMeter, Gatling
   - **Skills**:
     - Learn how to test the performance of web applications (load, stress, endurance testing).
     - Create scripts to simulate thousands of users and analyze performance bottlenecks.

### 5. **Front-End Testing**
   - **Tools**: Selenium (for UI), Cypress, Playwright, or JavaScript-based testing tools.
   - **Skills**: 
     - Testing front-end applications and interactions.
     - JavaScript/TypeScript knowledge (if you move into tools like Cypress).

### 6. **CI/CD Integration (DevOps)**
   - **Tools**: Jenkins, GitLab CI, CircleCI
   - **Skills**:
     - Integrate automated tests into Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery pipelines.
     - Learn how to trigger automated tests after every build or deployment.
     - Set up reporting (Allure, Extent Reports).

### 7. **Version Control & Collaboration**
   - **Tools**: Git, GitHub, GitLab
   - **Skills**:
     - Collaborate with developers and testers using version control systems.
     - Learn how to create branches, pull requests, and manage test code repositories.

### 8. **Cloud Platforms**
   - **Tools**: AWS, Azure, Google Cloud (optional but valuable)
   - **Skills**:
     - Understand cloud infrastructure and how applications are deployed in the cloud.
     - Testing cloud-based applications and services.

### 9. **Containerization & Virtualization**
   - **Tools**: Docker, Kubernetes (optional but useful)
   - **Skills**:
     - Understand how to run your tests in isolated environments using containers (Docker).
     - Automating tests within containers.

### 10. **Security Testing** (optional, but valuable)
   - **Tools**: OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite
   - **Skills**:
     - Learn the basics of security testing (SQL injection, XSS, etc.).
     - Automated security scanning of applications.

### 11. **Behavior-Driven Development (BDD)**
   - **Tools**: Cucumber, JBehave
   - **Skills**: 
     - Write tests in a more user-friendly format using Gherkin syntax (Given-When-Then).
     - Understand how BDD frameworks integrate with Selenium and API tests.

### 12. **Soft Skills**
   - **Collaboration**: Work closely with developers, product managers, and business stakeholders.
   - **Communication**: Report bugs, write test plans, and document your testing efforts effectively.

By building these skills, you can transition into a well-rounded **full-stack tester**, capable of testing everything from the user interface to the back-end, including APIs, databases, and performance, while working within DevOps pipelines.
